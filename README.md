# Encryption-Decryption-Project

The Encryption class will open a pre-existing file with text and will be encrypted to another file. The Decryption class will open the encryption file, read from it and then decrypts the the encrypted message. That message is then written into the decrypted file. The decryption file is then read from to the console.
